                            We know there are a lot of people getting certified in Microblading today.
                            We encourage you to do your research and make sure you are going to the best person possible.
                            But just because your sister-in-law or friend is now certified it doesn't mean she is the best person to do the treatment.
                            Would you go to your neighbors house to get a tattoo or would you prefer to go to a reputable business that offers clean, sanitary facilities and has taken all measures possible to ensure your safety?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most Microblading people work out of their homes. This is not a professional environment and can often times cause distractions as the focus can go other places.
                            Ask yourself, these questions before you get your face tattoo from someone. If they aren't all a resounding YES - go somewhere else!

                                            Microblading, also know by variety of names such as embroidery, microstroking, feather touch and hair like strokes, is a form of semi-permanent make-up.
                                            Microblading uses a small hand held tool of needles that mimic hairlike strokes into your eyebrows.
                                            Pigment is implanted into the upper layers of your skin giving it a natural look.
                                            Over time, pigment fades leaving the skin and your natural brows behind.

                                            This is the process of infusing pigment into the skin to simulate the appearance of filled in brows.
                                            This is perfect for clients who are perfectionists!!! Combination brows are done with hair strokes at the end of the brow, and then the rest filled in.
                                            This is a beautiful look for ALL skin types, and heals very soft and beautiful.
                                            This technique is the best of both worlds. It's also semi-permanent, but lasts a little longer than Microblading itself.

                                            We use our eyebrows to light up our faces with the various expressions we use throughout any given day, but, let’s face it… when left to their own devices, our eyebrows can get downright scary.
                                            From the infamous unibrow to business and more, it takes time and dedication to achieve just the right shape.
                                            Rather than going through painful tweezing and waxing routines, however, there’s a semi-permanent alternative that can help you achieve the look that works best with your face that’s guaranteed to last.

                                            To achieve maximum results, the microblading procedure performed  is split up into two sessions.
                                            In order to allow plenty of time for healing, these appointments are scheduled four to six weeks apart.
                                            Most of the work is completed during the initial appointment, and the finishing touches are completed during the second session, leaving you with a look you can always be confident in.
                                            Two days prior to the procedure, a test patch will need to be performed to best ensure best results.

                                            This is the process of depositing pigment into the epidermis (first layer) of the skin with a rotary machine pen.
                                            "Ombre Powdered" is the style where eyebrows are dark at the end of the tails gradually blending lighter toward the front of the eyebrows.
                                            This effect gives off a more natural look and is the trend at the moment. It gives an illusion that eyebrows had already been shaded in with makeup.
                                            Great for OILY skin, T-ZONE skin, and anyone with bare brows, or brows that have too many gaps.
                                            Also great for people who want a fuller eyebrow look, as the Microblading technique can look a bit too natural and not cover bald spots too well.

                                            Microblading, commonly known as eyebrow embroidery, is a revolutionary new cosmetic procedure that allows you to correct or reconstruct lost eyebrow.
                                            The pigment of your choice is deposited manually into the basal layer of your epidermis with the use of a pen.
                                            The time necessary to complete the procedure varies from one person to the next, but it’s recommended to have a color refresh every 18 months.

                                            If you’ve ever had your eyebrows waxed, you are likely concerned with the pain level involved with a typical microblading session.
                                            The good news is that most patients report only minor pain with some reporting no pain at all.
                                            It’s our goal that the process is as pain-free as possible, and we do offer minor anesthetics to numb the area we’ll be working on.
                                            The best news is that you can expect to get right back to your day after application. While the initial color will be stronger, it will soften after about two weeks.

                                    Microblading, also know by variety of names such as embroidery, microstroking, feather touch and hair like strokes, is a form of semi-permanent make-up.
                                    Microblading uses a small hand held tool of needles that mimic hairlike strokes into your eyebrows.
                                    Pigment is implanted into the upper layers of your skin giving it a natural look.
                                    Over time, pigment fades leaving the skin and your natural brows behind.

                                    This is the process of depositing pigment into the epidermis (first layer) of the skin with a rotary machine pen.
                                    "Ombre Powdered" is the style where eyebrows are dark at the end of the tails gradually blending lighter toward the front of the eyebrows.
                                    This effect gives off a more natural look and is the trend at the moment. It gives an illusion that eyebrows had already been shaded in with makeup.
                                    Great for OILY skin, T-ZONE skin, and anyone with bare brows, or brows that have too many gaps.
                                    Also great for people who want a fuller eyebrow look, as the Microblading technique can look a bit too natural and not cover bald spots too well.

                                    This is the process of infusing pigment into the skin to simulate the appearance of filled in brows.
                                    This is perfect for clients who are perfectionists!!! Combination brows are done with hair strokes at the end of the brow, and then the rest filled in.
                                    This is a beautiful look for ALL skin types, and heals very soft and beautiful.
                                    This technique is the best of both worlds. It's also semi-permanent, but lasts a little longer than Microblading itself.

                                    We use our eyebrows to light up our faces with the various expressions we use throughout any given day, but, let’s face it… when left to their own devices, our eyebrows can get downright scary.
                                    From the infamous unibrow to business and more, it takes time and dedication to achieve just the right shape.
                                    Rather than going through painful tweezing and waxing routines, however, there’s a semi-permanent alternative that can help you achieve the look that works best with your face that’s guaranteed to last.

                                    Microblading, commonly known as eyebrow embroidery, is a revolutionary new cosmetic procedure that allows you to correct or reconstruct lost eyebrow.
                                    The pigment of your choice is deposited manually into the basal layer of your epidermis with the use of a pen.
                                    The time necessary to complete the procedure varies from one person to the next, but it’s recommended to have a color refresh every 18 months.

                                    To achieve maximum results, the microblading procedure performed  is split up into two sessions.
                                    In order to allow plenty of time for healing, these appointments are scheduled four to six weeks apart.
                                    Most of the work is completed during the initial appointment, and the finishing touches are completed during the second session, leaving you with a look you can always be confident in.
                                    Two days prior to the procedure, a test patch will need to be performed to best ensure best results.

                                    If you’ve ever had your eyebrows waxed, you are likely concerned with the pain level involved with a typical microblading session.
                                    The good news is that most patients report only minor pain with some reporting no pain at all.
                                    It’s our goal that the process is as pain-free as possible, and we do offer minor anesthetics to numb the area we’ll be working on.
                                    The best news is that you can expect to get right back to your day after application. While the initial color will be stronger, it will soften after about two weeks.
