            This service is a semi permanent, noninvasive procedure that temporarily adjusts the direction of the natural brow pattern for a fuller and fluffier stylistic appearance. 
            It can be coupled with a brow tint for a darker appearance. The growth cycle of eyebrow hair is typically 90 days. 
            We recommend receiving the treatment every 2-3 months to ensure we keep the integrity of the hair.
