                                    Starts to become a translucent, fluffy jelly, which will retain its heat up to four times longer than regular water. 
                                    Within minutes, what began as a tub full of water evolves into a luxurious jelly bath like watching a magic trick while invigorating the nerves and tired muscles. 
                                    Feeling the bits of jelly between your toes and around all the muscles is a very relaxing way to enjoy a unique spa experience.

                                    Benefits of the Jelly Pedicure are that the dense jelly mixture massages stressed muscle and acts as a gentle exfoliate.

                                    Jelly retains water naturally and combined with the fragrant oils in the Jelly Pedicure, moisturizes and softens dry cracked skin.
