                        <p>
                            Our microneedling treatment is a minimally invasive procedure that uses fine needles to create tiny micro channels in the skin.
                            This triggers that body’s natural healing response, which stimulates the production of collagen and elastin - two key proteins that help to support the skin’s structures and keep it looking youthful and firm.

                        <p>
                            Our microneedling treatment can help to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, improve skin texture and tone, and reduce the visibility of scars and hyperpigmentation.
                            It’s a versatile treatment that can be customized to address your specific skin concerns, and it’s suitable for all skin types.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the treatment, our skilled and experienced technician will use a state-of-the-are microneedling device to create controlled punctures in the skin.
                            The procedure is generally well-tolerated, and most patients experience little to no discomfort.

                            After the treatment, you may experience some redness and mild swelling, but these side effects typically subside within a few days.

                            GUA SHA is a lifting & sculpting treatment rooted in traditional Chinese medicine that rejuvenates the neck, brow, and forehead.
                            Performing GUA SHA on the neck stimulates Qi in the face, and releases tension in the neck that helps minimize gravitational pull on the face.
                            The slow, rhythmic movement of the cool jade GUA SHA  tool along the face clears a pathway to flush toxins and lymph away, resulting in smoother lines and decreasing puffiness.
                            In addition to the traditional jade GUA SHA  tool, our expert estheticians use chilled quartz “mushroom” stones to soothe and relax tired eye muscles, and a finishing Hydro-jelly masque to add extra moisture at the end.
