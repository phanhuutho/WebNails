    We changed name! Paradise Nails Salon is officially renamed CRYSTAL SKY NAILS SPA. 
    Although the name changed, the owner of the shop is still me Nancy! So our old customers don’t worry about me. 
    I’ll always be there. Our talented staff  will always be there! The original intention of the change is Pursuing the purity of the mind, a good expectation. 
    It is a hope and a good vision for the future. Farewell to all the unpleasant past!
